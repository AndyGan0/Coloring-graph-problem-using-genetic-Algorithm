# Coloring-graph-problem-using-genetic-Algorithm
This project was created during my university's course "ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND EXPERT SYSTEMS". <br>
Language: Python<br>
<br>

This program implements a genetic algorithm to solve the well-known Coloring Graph Problem. <br>
These are the neighbors in the graph:<br>
[1,2], [1,3], [1,12], [2,3], [2,4], [2,11], [2,12], [3,4], [3,5], [3,6], [3,7], [4,7], [4,9], [5,6], [6,7], [7,8], [7,9], [8,9], [8,10], [9,10], [9,11], [10,11], [10,13], [11,12], [11,13], [12,13] <br><br>
